# Práctica 2: Introducción al Diseño Software

In this second practice session, we were asked to manually design a class diagram for a user interface that we will use for a company.

The process is as follows: A welcome message is displayed on the screen asking for a 5-digit user ID. If the user ID is entered incorrectly, the user will be returned to the welcome screen. If the user ID is entered correctly, the user will be asked for an 8-digit NIF (Tax ID Number). As in the previous example, if the NIF is incorrect, the user will be returned to the welcome screen.

If the NIF is correct, the dashboard will be displayed, including all the available options for viewing log data from the last hour, and the "exit" option, which returns to the welcome screen.

If one of the available options is selected on the dashboard, all changes from the last hour will be displayed, with a "back" option, which will reappear with all the available options. If the selected option is incorrect, all possible options numbered 1 to 7 will be displayed again (1 to 6 are the logs for each item, and 7 is the option to log out of the system).
