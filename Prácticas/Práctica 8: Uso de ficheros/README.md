# Práctica 8: Uso de Ficheros

This practice requires you to use the concepts discussed in class about files. For this specific case, you are asked to create a binary file to store the user(s) who log into the monitoring system's dashboard.

To do this, the write() function has been created inside the ['Usuario.cpp'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/blob/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%208%3A%20Uso%20de%20ficheros/src/Usuario.cpp) file, which stores the users who have logged into the system and who have been created using the user management menu in the ['users.dat'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/blob/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%208%3A%20Uso%20de%20ficheros/src/users.dat) file.
