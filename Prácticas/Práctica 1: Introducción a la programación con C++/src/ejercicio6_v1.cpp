Goal: Write an application that displays a checkerboard pattern 
like the one below. Do it first using eight output instructions 
(cout), and then do it trying to use as few instructions as 
possible.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "* * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << " * * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << "* * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << " * * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << "* * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << " * * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << "* * * * * * * *\n";
    cout << " * * * * * * * *\n";
