# Práctica 6: Uso de la Plantilla Set de STL para almacenar (sin duplicar) a un Conjunto de Objetos de Tipo Usuario

This practice requires, starting with the creation of a class called Users, to implement basic use of the STL (Standard Template Library) template set, which serves as a container for storing the different users who log into the system.

For this purpose, a file called ['Users.cpp'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/blob/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%206%3A%20Uso%20de%20plantilla%20set%20de%20STL%20para%20almacenar%20(sin%20duplicar)%20a%20un%20conjunto%20de%20objetos%20Usuario/src/Users.cpp) has been created in which a basic use of this template is implemented, in addition to containing some of its main functions (such as creating a container, inserting elements, deleting them, exchanging their contents with that of another container, knowing their size / maximum size, deleting all the contents of a container, etc).
