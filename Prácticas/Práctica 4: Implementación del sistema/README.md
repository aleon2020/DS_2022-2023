# Práctica 4: Implementación del Sistema

This practice requires you to perform the first implementation of the monitoring system designed in previous practices.

**IMPORTANT**: The repository for this practice has changed its layout as the course progresses.

The following image shows the class diagram on which my implementation is based, adding visibility markers to each of the members and methods of each class.

In the repository ['Clases por separado'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/tree/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%204%3A%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20del%20sistema/src/Clases%20por%20separado) is a directory for each of the classes that make up the class diagram, and within the directory of each class a small test has been done to verify that each of the classes works separately.

In the repository ['Clases padre e hijas'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/tree/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%204%3A%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20del%20sistema/src/Clases%20padre%20e%20hijas) are 3 files, one for each parent class in the class diagram, where inheritance has been used so that child classes can use the methods of the parent class without needing to create an object for the parent classes.

And finally, the file ['SistemaMonitorización.cpp'](https://github.com/aleon2020/DS_2022-2023/blob/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas/Pr%C3%A1ctica%204%3A%20Implementaci%C3%B3n%20del%20sistema/src/SistemaMonitorizacion.cpp) contains the implementation of the system in which everything created previously has been united.
