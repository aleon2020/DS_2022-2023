# Práctica 3: Identificación de las Clases en la Especificación de Requerimientos

This practice includes a new, improved and digitized version of the Class Diagram created in Practice 2, this time developed in the UMLet application. It includes many more functions beyond those already included in the previous diagram.

The process works as follows: A welcome message appears on the screen asking for a 5-digit user ID. If the user ID is entered incorrectly, the user will return to the welcome screen. If the user ID is entered correctly, the user will be asked for an 8-digit NIF (Tax ID Number). As in the previous example, if the NIF is entered incorrectly, the user will return to the welcome screen.

If both the user number and the NIF are correct, the dashboard will be displayed, showing all the sensors available for viewing log data from the last hour, and an "exit" option, which will return to the welcome screen.

If the correct option is selected from the dashboard, all the changes made in the last hour will be displayed, with a "return" option, which will reappear with all the available options. If the selected option is incorrect, all the possible options numbered 1 to 7 will be displayed again (1 to 6 are for accessing the logs for each sensor, and 7 is the option to log out of the system).
