## 1. IMPORTANT things to keep in mind

First of all, before you venture into the entire contents of this repository, it's important to remember that this is an "incremental" course in terms of practice, that is, it starts with basic C++ concepts (practice 1) and ends with the final implementation of a system that was presented to us at the beginning of the course.

This course we have been asked to implement a monitoring system for a greenhouse, which is composed of several sensors that collect data (all in a simulated way), so the first practices consist of creating a diagram by hand of how this system could work and then passing it to UML, then the classes and methods will be created (already using code) that make up the system, and everything that comes after is implementing at the code level new concepts that are seen in Theory (overload operators, containers, debugging, use of files, etc ...).

So I recommend that you first look at PRACTICE 9 in detail, which implements all the concepts, and then go from practice 1 to practice 8 to understand and see the complete evolution of the system as new concepts have been seen.
